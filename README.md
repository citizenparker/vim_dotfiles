# vim_dotfiles

My personal vim setup, based largely on the Braintree default vim setup with bells and whistles removed.

## Installation

After cloning this project, you can run the following to link these dotfiles
into your home directory:

```
> rake activate
```

## TODO

What follows below is my old list of Bundles. I am still tempted to switch back to Vundle. This is here for reference.
```
" let Vundle manage Vundle
" required! 
Bundle 'gmarik/vundle'
Bundle 'L9'

Bundle 'The-NERD-Commenter'
Bundle 'rails.vim'
Bundle 'ctrlp.vim'
" non github repos
Bundle 'railscasts'
Bundle 'ack.vim'
Bundle 'cucumber.zip'
Bundle 'VimClojure'
Bundle 'mru.vim'
Bundle 'The-NERD-tree'
Bundle 'camelcasemotion'
